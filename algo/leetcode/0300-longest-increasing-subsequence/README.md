### 300. Longest Increasing Subsequence

https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence

`Medium`

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.

**Example**:
```
Input: [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4 
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4. 
```

**Example 2**:
```
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]
Output: 4
```

**Example 3**:
```
Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]
Output: 1
```

**Note**:
* There may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.
* Your algorithm should run in O(n2) complexity.

**Constraints**:

* `1 <= nums.length <= 2500`
* `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`

**Follow up**: Could you improve it to `O(n log n)` time complexity?
